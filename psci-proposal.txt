This VA Patient Safety Center of Inquiry focuses on measurement of
patient safety. Prior work has developed *e-triggers,* which enable
the measurement of diagnostic safety issues via electronic health
record data, whereas the current work will **implement** these
measurement tools in practice and leverage the knowledge gained.
Specifically, the "Diagnosis Improvement Safety Center" (DISCovery)
will develop the Safer Dx e-trigger change package, called **Safer Dx
ENGAGE,** to disseminate measurement of diagnostic errors in primary
care. Broadly, the process will follow the *Measure Dx*
Resource.[^measuredx]

# Prepare

All organizations---including VA Medical Centers---are different.
Change and implementation should start with someone interested and
invested, but they may have different interests or roles within the
organization. The Safer Dx team and the champion will engage
leadership and other stakeholders throughout the organization, build a
team, and foster psychological safety. Implementation of new
measurement strategies and change approaches must account for
organizational and other non-technical issues, or electronic tools
will not lead to improvements.[^socio]

# Self Assessment

The *Safer Dx Checklist* will provide a framework for this step.[^check] Each
DISCovery site will determine its priorities and how e-triggers could
be employed to have the most impact. Sites will select one or more
measurement strategies, and they will ensure that sufficient resources
are available for diagnostic safety measurement activities.

# Strategies (ENGAGE Section 1)

The Houston-based team will provide guidance on how to implement
e-triggers. We will host the following: general meetings,
didactic-style technical sessions for programmers and data managers,
office hour sessions for high-throughput question/answer, email, and
clinical interpretation sessions.[^transl] Each DISCovery site should
decide who within the organization is ultimately going to receive the
data, meaning who is going to take action based on it.[^feedback] See

# Review cases (ENGAGE Section 2)

FIXME

This is an important step. We have checked these in other VAs, and the
accuracy or clinical relevance varies. Sometimes lots of false positives,
sometimes good an interesting signal. Decide *who* will review cases.
The IT people need to know names of people and a means to send cases
for review. How many do you have the capacity to review? (No right
answer.) In particular, the *Revised Safer Dx Instrument*[^rsdi] will be
central to determining the presence/abscence of missed opportunities
for diagnosis.

# Assess implementation (ENGAGE Sections 3-4)

The DISCovery sites will reflect on the process in cooperation with
the Houston team and determine how the process was used for (1)
analysis, (2) feedback, and (3) learning. In other words, was *Safer
Dx ENGAGE* appropriate for the task, given the interviews we did at
your facility to develop it? The end result of this step is to deliver
what *other VAMCs* may need to know, including:

- Best practices to create and improve metrics for diagnostic safety

- Strategies

- Action steps

- Software

- Documentation

- E-trigger performance statistics for VA's Centralized Phenomics
