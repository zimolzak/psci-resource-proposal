This VA Patient Safety Center of Inquiry focuses on measurement of
patient safety. Prior work has developed *e-triggers,* which enable
the measurement of diagnostic safety issues via electronic health
record data, whereas the current work will **implement** these
measurement tools in practice and leverage the knowledge gained.
Specifically, the "Diagnosis Improvement Safety Center" (DISCovery)
will develop the Safer Dx e-trigger change package, called **Safer Dx
ENGAGE,** to disseminate measurement of diagnostic errors in primary
care.




## Prepare

All organizations---including VA Medical Centers---are different.
Change and implementation should start with someone interested and
invested, but they may have different interests or roles within the
organization. The Safer Dx team and the champion will engage
leadership and other stakeholders throughout the organization, build a
team, and foster psychological safety. Implementation of new
measurement strategies and change approaches must account for
organizational and other non-technical issues, or electronic tools
will not lead to improvements.[^socio]

## Self Assessment

Pretty much use the instrument. How to interpret it. What do you make
of it? What are your priorities? What is a one that would make a
pretty big splash? Or okay, maybe you just implement. Ensure that
sufficient resources are available for diagnostic safety measurement
activities. Select one or more measurement strategies.




## Strategies (ENGAGE Section 1)

Guidance on how to implement e-triggers. We will have the following:
general meetings, didactic type technical sessions, office hours,
email, clinical interpretation sessions. Who is ultimately going to
get the data, meaning who are the ones who do something with it?
(Primary care, hospitalists, ER, etc.)




## Review cases (ENGAGE Section 2)

This is an important step. We have checked these in other VAs, and the
accuracy or clinical relevance varies. Sometimes lots of false positives,
sometimes good an interesting signal. Decide *who* will review cases.
The IT people need to know names of people and a means to send cases
for review. How many do you have the capacity to review? (No right answer.)




## Assess implementation (ENGAGE Sections 3-4)

How was it used for (1) analysis, (2) feedback, (3) learning? Was
change package appropriate given the interviews we did at your
facility? Deliver what other VAs need to know:

- Best practices to create and improve metrics for diagnostic safety
- Strategies
- Action steps
- Software
- Documentation
- E-trigger performance for VAâ€™s Centralized Phenomics Resource
