## Prepare

Organizations are different. Bigger, smaller. Start off with *someone*
interested, but different levels of that. It is about VA facilities.
Say "Safer Dx ENGAGE." *Venenatis id, pellentesque sit amet nisl. Nunc
vel arcu vitae neque varius volutpat id in tortor. Nulla quam lacus,
vestibulum eget consectetur et, accumsan non turpis. Nulla facilisi.*

## Self Assessment

Pretty much use the instrument. How to interpret it. What do you make
of it? What are your priorities? What settings? Could be inpatient.
Etc. What is a one that would make a pretty big splash? Or okay, maybe
you just implement. *Erat volutpat. Maecenas fringilla purus non
tortor porta at convallis lacus lacinia.*

## Strategies (ENGAGE Section 1)

Guidance on how to implement e-triggers. We will have the following:
general meetings, didactic type techincal sessions, office hours,
email, clinical interpretation sessions. Who is ultimately going to
get the data, meaning who are the ones who do something with it?
(Primary care, hospitalists, ER, etc.)

## Review cases (ENGAGE Section 2)

This is an important step. We have checked these in other VAs, and the
accuracy or clinical relevance varies. Sometimes lots of false positives,
sometimes good an interesting signal. Decide *who* will review cases.
The IT people need to know names of people and a means to send cases
for review. How many do you have the capacity to review? (No right answer.)

## Assess implementation (ENGAGE Sections 3-4)

How was it used for (1) analysis, (2) feedback, (3) learning? Was
change package appropriate given the interviews we did at your
facility? Deliver what other VAs need to know:

- best practices to measure, improve, create metrics for dx safety
- strategies
- action steps
- software
- documentation
- e-triggers performance to VAâ€™s centralized phenomics resource
