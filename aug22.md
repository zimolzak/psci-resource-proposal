# Overview of Safer Dx EnGAGE


# (1) Introduction: Orientation to the fundamentals of diagnostic safety


# (2) Team: Assembling a team with necessary expertise and other resources needed for implementing e-triggers


# (3) Self-Assessment: Assessment and identification of appropriate e-trigger(s)

This section will guide sites to determine their priorities and
understand how e-triggers could be employed to have the greatest impact.
The *Measure Dx Organizational Readiness Checklist*[^3] will provide a
framework for this step.[^4] Sites will select one or more measurement
strategies, and they will ensure that sufficient resources are available
for diagnostic safety measurement activities. Sites must ensure
sufficient personnel and technical resources are available and enrolled
on the project to:

1.  Determine what diagnostic safety tools already exist at the medical
    center.

2.  Collect data about diagnostic safety.

3.  Respond effectively when opportunities for improvement are
    discovered.

The *Measure Dx Checklist* will aid participating facilities in
assessing their readiness to start the project and where further efforts
may be required before beginning.

# (4) Strategy: Implement electronic health record-based trigger and prepare for chart review

VA facilities may use EHR data to inform their measurement of diagnostic
safety. This approach could also be augmented with the strategy of
soliciting information about diagnostic safety directly from clinicians.
Additionally, facilities should address the following points:

1.  Identify the appropriate EHR data warehouse for queries

2.  Who will access the data warehouse and support the team with EHR
    queries?

3.  Is there a team member who understands clinical data
    quality/validation?

4.  Identify the process for requesting EHR data, running queries, and
    generating reports

Each site should decide who within the organization is ultimately going
to receive the data, meaning who is going to take action based on
it.[^5] In previous projects, database personnel at certain sites did
not know the names of the clinical team members who would validate
e-trigger cases; this should be avoided. Communication with end users
will also guide the format in which recipients wish to receive feedback
and ensure all the desired data elements will be retrieved by the
e-trigger code. See also: VA's *Communication Of Test Results
Toolkit*.[^6]

# (5) Review: Review of e-trigger identified cases to confirm accuracy, and any required e-trigger customization

An important step in the development of any e-trigger is ensuring its
accuracy and clinical relevance. This is achieved by the verification of
the output data generated by the e-trigger, and this section of *Safer
Dx EnGAGE* will orient users to this process. This will cover field
testing of the e-trigger's accuracy, a multi-step process where the
retrieved data are systematically reviewed by clinically trained staff
serving as chart reviewers. Following the chart review, any necessary
amendments will be made, and then the new e-trigger's output data is
again reviewed by chart reviewers.

1.  These chart review processes will identify data quality and
    completeness issues of the e-trigger results. Chart reviewers may
    confer with the members of the stakeholder team (especially clinical
    leaders and clinicians) to determine whether the e-trigger meets the
    project and organizational goals or whether changes to the e-trigger
    are needed.

2.  This information will provide feedback to the data
    analysts/programmers responsible for developing the e-trigger so
    that they can incorporate changes to the SQL code. Clinical
    stakeholders may suggest changes to the inclusion and exclusion
    criteria to the developers, who will revise the e-trigger code.

3.  The newly revised e-trigger will be run, the same process of chart
    review to check for accuracy and clinical relevance will be
    repeated, and any changes recommended will be made to the e-trigger.
    This process will be repeated until the accuracy and clinical
    relevance reach or exceed the agreed threshold.

4.  Once the e-trigger has been optimized and clinicians confirm its
    accuracy to retrieve data identifying opportunities for diagnostic
    safety improvements, this actionable information will be
    communicated to stakeholders (especially quality and safety
    personnel), who will need to become knowledgeable on how to
    operationalize it.

This e-trigger optimization process can be iterative and time-consuming
but is necessary to ensure the e-trigger achieves the desired levels of
accuracy and clinical relevance. Adequate time should be allocated in
the local implementation timeline and project plan to accommodate this.
Individual sites will determine how many cases they can sample to
validate and review during the chart review process.

As outlined earlier, implementing sites will decide who will review
cases. Additionally, the data managers and programmers need to know how
to deliver the data to clinical personnel for validation. It is
therefore essential to a smooth e-trigger validation process that these
members of the team communicate and work together in a cohesive and
integrated way. Lastly, the *Revised Safer Dx Instrument*[^7] will be
central to determining the presence/absence of missed opportunities for
diagnosis.

# (6) Assessment: Analysis of e-trigger implementation

## Putting knowledge obtained into action

The results retrieved from the e-trigger may be in a format that is not
conducive to interpretation by personnel from diverse backgrounds. To
maximize utilization of the results obtained, this stage of the project
will focus on improving user interfaces of the tools used to display the
data. Engagement with informatics personnel will help disseminate the
e-trigger results. Participants will analyze and communicate the
retrieved data by way of graphs, reports, interactive dashboards with
drill-down capabilities, and other enhanced data visualization
mechanisms.

In addition to developing visualization tools for displaying the
results, informatics personnel in the stakeholder team will support the
sustainability of the e-triggers by being closely involved with the
enhancement of the queries. Front-line users will give feedback to data
personnel, which will inform standardized data definitions, analytical
approaches, and methods to display and communicate the e-trigger
results. This documentation process for the e-trigger queries and other
associated technical requirements will enable future enhancements as
necessitated by changes in organizational operations.

## Developing Strategies to Learn from the Triggers

Site stakeholders should review and determine how the triggers were used
for (1) analysis, (2) feedback, and (3) learning. Project
completion/debriefing meetings may be held to gather feedback from
clinical leaders, clinicians, and the wider stakeholder team. This step
aims to recommend ways that users can choose a diagnostic safety target
considering organizational priorities, available resources, and
availability of data relevant to the team's goal.

# Addendum: Implementing elsewhere

What if you are a future user of *Safer Dx EnGAGE* who wants to
implement e-triggers in a VA, but *using Cerner?* Or what if you
happened upon this resource but don't work within VA?
