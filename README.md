# Proposal

## Objective

The Diagnosis Improvement Safety Center (DISCovery), funded by VA's
National Center for Patient Safety, focuses on measurement of diagnostic
safety. Prior work by our DISCovery team includes the development of a
series of Safer Dx framework-guided rules-based *e-triggers* that, via
the electronic health record, facilitate the measurement of diagnostic
errors in primary care and emergency department settings. The resulting
set of Safer Dx e-triggers has undergone extensive testing and
refinement. However, use at particular VA sites has necessitated
extensive implementation help by our study team in the past. As such, we
now aim to create a guide that will enable implementation of these
e-triggers across VA facilities at a national level with very little
need for direct facilitation by our study team.

VA sites' practices and data may vary, so these Safer Dx e-triggers may
require customization to optimize their performance and effectiveness
when implemented into clinical practice at individual sites. The goal of
this guide (to be named *Safer Dx EnGAGE*) is to allow individual sites
to take these contextual factors into account and successfully implement
the e-triggers on their own.

## Audience

This proposal will outline our plan to create the guidance needed for
sites to implement these Safer Dx e-triggers into practice at any VA
medical center. The initial phase will involve creation of *Safer Dx
EnGAGE*, the guide that will provide step-by-step instructions for the
implementation of the e-triggers at any VA sites. Subsequent phases will
involve assessing how sites use *Safer Dx EnGAGE* for learning and
improvement.

## Development process

We will approach the design and development of the *Safer Dx EnGAGE*
resource iteratively, seeking feedback from stakeholders, including
potential organizational users and external subject matter experts along
the way. We will solicit feedback on the overall content (e.g., did we
include all of the sections that would be needed for someone to
successfully implement triggers) as well as on the detailed content. Key
steps include:

1.  Early in development, we will engage stakeholders to reach consensus
    on the scope and general form of the resource. The initial
    stakeholder meetings will be used to create a "shared mental model"
    of the resource.

2.  We will iteratively design a working draft of the resource, working
    with small groups of two or three people, focusing on (a) the
    resource as a whole, and on (b) sections for which specific content
    expertise is needed. Teams will include subject matter experts and
    representative potential organizational users for the resource.
    Their feedback (obtained using a series of coproduction sessions)
    will be used to refine the resource's content and guide development
    of the remaining content.

3.  We will present a draft to key stakeholders and make additional
    refinements based on their feedback.

4.  We will conduct a pilot test to evaluate potential end users'
    experiences of using the resource, the barriers/facilitators to
    acting on recommendations, and additional considerations for
    dissemination and implementation of the resource.

Although stakeholders will co-create the resource with us, we have
created an initial framework for what might go in the *Safer Dx EnGAGE*
resource as a starting point. This is described below but will likely
change with stakeholder input.

## Overview of Safer Dx EnGAGE

*Safer Dx EnGAGE* will guide VA facilities to implement e-triggers in
primary care. It will broadly follow advice previously given in the
*Measure Dx Resource*[^measure] (which advises hospital systems about
measuring and preventing diagnostic errors). Like *Measure Dx*, *Safer
Dx EnGAGE* will proceed according to the following outline.

# (1) Purpose statement

FIXME

For clinicians: *To identify patients at risk for diagnostic safety
events.* Prove that this is currently not possible.

For quality, safety, and administrative personnel: *To identify
patients at risk for diagnostic safety events, at the clinic or
facility level.*

Selling point: will help you decide what's most approp for you (your VA).

Who is *which section* for?

Role  Intro  Team  Self-Assessment  Implemen  Review  Assessment
----  -----  ----  ---------------  -----     ----    -----
cham  yes    yes   yes                                yes
clin  yes                                     yes
data  yes                           yes




# (2) Introduction: Orientation to the fundamentals of diagnostic safety

The introduction will provide a brief orientation to the issue of
diagnostic safety measurement and its relevance to organizations. Users
are introduced to the potential benefits of adopting strategies
described in the toolkit. Users are also oriented to the general idea
that VA Medical centers vary in their structure, organization, patient
populations, and operational goals. As such there may be a need for some
changes or additions to current practices at participating centers to
prepare for the implementation of the Safer Dx e-triggers.
Implementation of new measurement strategies and change management
processes must account for organizational and other non-technical
issues, or electronic tools will not lead to improvements.[^model]




# (3) Team: Assembling a team with necessary expertise and other resources needed for implementing e-triggers

Successful implementation and use of e-triggers depends on
participation of many individuals at any given site. For example, buy-in from
leadership as well as the user community of an organization is
necessary for successful implementation. This section will guide users
to identify those interested and invested in use of e-triggers for
diagnostic safety measurement as well as identify all resources needed to
accomplish e-trigger implementation.

Key individuals within the organization may be involved in terms of
implementing the e-triggers or refining content for the e-triggers.
Individuals should work as an engaged team with dedicated hours to
facilitate e-trigger use. They may have different existing interests
or roles within the organization, but they will need to come together
to successfully use and learn from the e-triggers at their site. The
team will need to engage leadership and other stakeholders throughout the
organization, raising awareness and promoting the project's goals to
achieve buy-in from the wider stakeholder community. This section will
describe possible roles on the stakeholder team, including: clinical
leadership, clinical operations, project manager, quality improvement,
patient safety, chart reviewer, data manager, system administrator,
programmers, and developers. Additionally, a structured change
management process will be outlined in the resource to facilitate the
teamâ€™s work.




# (4) Self-Assessment: Assessment and identification of appropriate e-trigger(s)

This section will guide sites to determine their priorities and
understand how e-triggers could be employed to have the greatest impact.
The *Measure Dx Organizational Readiness Checklist*[^appendix] will provide a
framework for this step.[^measure] Sites will select one or more measurement
strategies, and they will ensure that sufficient resources are available
for diagnostic safety measurement activities. Sites must ensure
sufficient personnel and technical resources are available and enrolled
on the project to:

1.  Determine what diagnostic safety tools already exist at the medical
    center.

2.  Collect data about diagnostic safety.

3.  Respond effectively when opportunities for improvement are
    discovered.

The *Measure Dx Checklist* will aid participating facilities in
assessing their readiness to start the project and where further
efforts may be required before beginning.




FIXME

A lot more emph on: FIND WHAT (dashboard) EXIST(S) and don't reinvent it.

## Types of triggers

- missed test
- escalation

## Case study

To illustrate, etc etc., here is a case study:

> little "box 1" case study, "greater LA found out that this was already implemented, so they decided to...."




# (5) Strategy: Implement electronic health record-based trigger and prepare for chart review

VA facilities may use EHR data to inform their measurement of
diagnostic safety. This approach could also be augmented with the
strategy of soliciting information about diagnostic safety directly
from clinicians. Additionally, facilities should address the following
points:

1. Identify the appropriate EHR data warehouse for queries

2. Who will access the data warehouse and support the team with EHR
   queries?

3. Is there a team member who understands clinical data
   quality/validation?

4.  Identify the process for requesting EHR data, running queries, and
    generating reports

Each site should decide who within the organization is ultimately going
to receive the data, meaning who is going to take action based on
it.[^feedback] In previous projects, database personnel at certain sites did
not know the names of the clinical team members who would validate
e-trigger cases; this should be avoided. Communication with end users
will also guide the format in which recipients wish to receive feedback
and ensure all the desired data elements will be retrieved by the
e-trigger code. See also: VA's *Communication Of Test Results
Toolkit*.[^toolkit]




# (6) Review: Review of e-trigger identified cases to confirm accuracy, and any required e-trigger customization.

An important step in the development of any e-trigger is ensuring its
accuracy and clinical relevance. This is achieved by the verification of
the output data generated by the e-trigger, and this section of *Safer
Dx EnGAGE* will orient users to this process. This will cover field
testing of the e-trigger's accuracy, a multi-step process where the
retrieved data are systematically reviewed by clinically trained staff
serving as chart reviewers. Following the chart review, any necessary
amendments will be made, and then the new e-trigger's output data is
again reviewed by chart reviewers.

1. These chart review processes will identify data quality and
  completeness issues of the e-trigger results. Chart reviewers may
  confer with the members of the stakeholder team (especially clinical
  leaders and clinicians) to determine whether the e-trigger meets the
  project and organizational goals or whether changes to the e-trigger
  are needed.

2. This information will provide feedback to the data
  analysts/programmers responsible for developing the e-trigger so
  that they can incorporate changes to the data pull algorithm. Clinical
  stakeholders may suggest changes to the inclusion and exclusion
  criteria to the developers, who will revise the e-trigger code.

3. The newly revised e-trigger will be run, the same process of chart
  review to check for accuracy and clinical relevance will be
  repeated, and any changes recommended will be made to the e-trigger.
  This process will be repeated until the accuracy and clinical
  relevance reach or exceed the agreed threshold.

4. Once the e-trigger has been optimized and clinicians confirm its
  accuracy to retrieve data identifying opportunities for diagnostic
  safety improvements, this actionable information will be
  communicated to stakeholders (especially quality and safety
  personnel), who will need to become knowledgeable on how to
  operationalize it.

This e-trigger optimization process can be iterative and
time-consuming but is necessary to ensure the e-trigger achieves the
desired levels of accuracy and clinical relevance. Adequate time
should be allocated in the local implementation timeline and project
plan to accommodate this. Individual sites will determine how many
cases they can sample to validate and review during the chart review
process.

As outlined earlier, implementing sites will decide who will review
cases. Additionally, the data managers and programmers need to know how
to deliver the data to clinical personnel for validation. It is
therefore essential to a smooth e-trigger validation process that these
members of the team communicate and work together in a cohesive and
integrated way. Lastly, the *Revised Safer Dx Instrument*[^revised] will be
central to determining the presence/absence of missed opportunities for
diagnosis.




# (7) Assessment: Analysis of e-trigger implementation

## Putting knowledge obtained into action

The results retrieved from the e-trigger may be in a format that is
not conducive to interpretation by personnel from diverse backgrounds.
To maximize utilization of the results obtained, this stage of the
project will focus on improving user interfaces of the tools used to
display the data. Engagement with informatics personnel will help disseminate the
e-trigger results. Participants will analyze and communicate the retrieved data
by way of graphs, reports, interactive dashboards with drill-down
capabilities, and other enhanced data visualization mechanisms.

In addition to developing visualization tools for displaying the
results, informatics personnel in the stakeholder team will support the
sustainability of the e-triggers by being closely involved with the
enhancement of the queries. Front-line users will give feedback to data
personnel, which will inform standardized data definitions, analytical
approaches, and methods to display and communicate the e-trigger
results. This documentation process for the e-trigger queries and other
associated technical requirements will enable future enhancements as
necessitated by changes in organizational operations.

## Developing strategies to learn from the e-triggers

Site stakeholders should review and determine how the e-triggers were used
for (1) analysis, (2) feedback, and (3) learning. Project
completion/debriefing meetings may be held to gather feedback from
clinical leaders, clinicians, and the wider stakeholder team. This step
aims to recommend ways that users can choose a diagnostic safety target
considering organizational priorities, available resources, and
availability of data relevant to the team's goal.




# Addendum: Implementing elsewhere

What if you are a future user of *Safer Dx EnGAGE* who wants to
implement e-triggers in a VA, but *using Cerner?* Or what if you
happened upon this resource but don't work within VA?

This section will be analogous with a prior seven-step process about
electronic trigger tools for diagnostic safety.[^application]
