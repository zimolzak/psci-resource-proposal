# Objective

The Diagnosis Improvement Safety Center (DISCovery), funded by VA's
National Center for Patient Safety, focuses on measurement of
diagnostic safety. Prior work by our DISCovery team includes the
development of a series of Safer Dx framework-guided rules-based
*e-triggers* that, via the electronic health record, facilitate the
identification of potential diagnostic errors in primary care and emergency
department settings. The resulting set of Safer Dx e-triggers has
undergone extensive testing and refinement. However, use at particular
VA sites has necessitated extensive implementation help by our study
team in the past. As such, we now aim to create a guide that will
enable implementation of these e-triggers across VA facilities at a
national level with very little need for direct facilitation by our
study team.

VA sites' practices and data may vary, so these Safer Dx e-triggers
may require customization to optimize their performance and
effectiveness when implemented into clinical practice at individual
sites. The goal of this guide (to be named *Safer Dx EnGAGE*) is to
allow individual sites to take these contextual factors into account
and successfully implement the e-triggers on their own.

# Audience

This proposal will outline our plan to create the guidance needed for
sites to implement these Safer Dx e-triggers into practice at any VA
medical center. The initial phase will involve creation of *Safer Dx
EnGAGE*, the guide that will provide step-by-step instructions for the
implementation of the e-triggers at any VA sites. Subsequent phases
will involve assessing how sites use *Safer Dx EnGAGE* for learning
and improvement.

# Development process

We will approach the design and development of the *Safer Dx EnGAGE*
guide iteratively, seeking feedback from stakeholders, including
potential organizational users and external subject matter experts
along the way. We will solicit feedback on the overall content (e.g.,
did we include all of the sections that would be needed for someone to
successfully implement triggers) as well as on the detailed content.
Key steps include:

1. Early in development, we will engage stakeholders to reach
    consensus on the scope and general form of the guide. The
    initial stakeholder meetings will be used to create a "shared
    mental model" of the guide.

2. We will iteratively design a working draft of the guide, working
    with small groups of two or three people, focusing on (a) the
    guide as a whole, and on (b) sections for which specific
    content expertise is needed. Teams will include subject matter
    experts and representative potential organizational users of the
    guide. Their feedback (obtained using a series of coproduction
    sessions) will be used to refine the guide's content and guide
    development of the remaining content.

3. We will present a draft to key stakeholders and make additional
    refinements based on their feedback.

4. We will conduct a pilot test to evaluate potential end users'
    experiences of using the guide, the barriers/facilitators to
    acting on recommendations, and additional considerations for
    dissemination and implementation of the guide.

Although stakeholders will co-create the guide with us, we have
created an initial framework for what might go in the *Safer Dx
EnGAGE* guide as a starting point. This is described below but will
likely change with stakeholder input.

# Overview of Safer Dx EnGAGE

*Safer Dx EnGAGE* will guide VA facilities to implement e-triggers in
primary care. It will broadly follow advice previously given in the
*Measure Dx* resource[^measure] (which advises hospital systems about
measuring and preventing diagnostic errors). *Safer
Dx EnGAGE* will proceed according to the following structure.

# (1) Why this guide?

For clinicians:
: To identify patients at risk for diagnostic safety events. This
should focus on a form of safety event detection that is currently not
possible.

For quality, safety, and administrative personnel:
: To identify patients at risk for diagnostic safety events, at the
clinic or facility level.

This guide will help you not only find patients at risk for diagnostic
safety events, but *decide what events to focus on,* depending on your
VAMC's current initiatives, priorities, and capabilities.

Implementing e-triggers in practice must be a group effort, with no
one person performing all the work. Everyone on the implementation
team should read the complete guide, but the following table
illustrates which sections of the guide also require input, contributions, or edits from
certain team members.

# (2) Introduction: Orientation to the fundamentals of diagnostic safety

The introduction will provide a brief orientation to the issue of
diagnostic safety measurement and its relevance to organizations.
Users are introduced to the potential benefits of adopting strategies
described in the toolkit. Users are also oriented to the general idea
that VA Medical centers vary in their structure, organization, patient
populations, and operational goals. As such, there may be a need for
some changes or additions to current practices at participating
centers to prepare for the implementation of the Safer Dx e-triggers.
Implementation of new measurement strategies and change management
processes must account for organizational and other non-technical
issues, or electronic tools will not lead to improvements.[^model]




# (3) Team: Assembling a team with necessary expertise and other resources needed for implementing e-triggers

Successful implementation and use of e-triggers depends on
participation of many individuals at any given site. For example,
buy-in from leadership as well as the user community of an
organization is necessary for successful implementation. This section
will guide users to identify those interested and invested in use of
e-triggers for diagnostic safety measurement, as well as identify all
resources needed to accomplish e-trigger implementation.

Key individuals within the organization may be involved in terms of
implementing the e-triggers or refining content for the e-triggers.
Individuals should work as an engaged team with protected time to
facilitate e-trigger use. They may have different existing interests
or roles within the organization, but they will need to come together
to successfully use and learn from the e-triggers at their site. The
team will need to engage leadership and other stakeholders throughout
the organization, raising awareness and promoting the project's goals
to achieve buy-in from the wider stakeholder community. This section
will describe possible roles on the stakeholder team, including:
clinical leadership, clinical operations, project manager, quality
improvement, patient safety, chart reviewer, data manager, system
administrator, programmers, and developers. Additionally, a structured
change management process will be outlined in this section to
facilitate the teamâ€™s work.




# (4) Self-Assessment: Assessment and identification of appropriate e-trigger(s)

This section will guide sites to determine their priorities and
understand how e-triggers could be employed to have the greatest
impact. The *Measure Dx General Organizational Readiness Checklist*
will provide a framework for this step. (See Part II, p.\ 8 of *Measure Dx*.[^appendix]) Sites will select
one or more measurement strategies, and they will ensure that
sufficient resources are available for diagnostic safety measurement
activities. Sites must ensure sufficient personnel and technical
resources are available and enrolled on the project to:

1. Determine what diagnostic safety tools already exist at the medical
    center. For example, what diagnostic tests already have a system
    in place to promote closed-loop follow-up of abnormal test results? Or, what
    data display or dashboard platforms already exist, which could be
    reused for new e-triggers?

2.  Collect data about diagnostic safety.

3. Respond effectively when opportunities for improvement are
    discovered.

The *Measure Dx General Organizational Readiness Checklist* will aid participating facilities in
assessing their readiness to start the project and where further
efforts may be required before beginning.

## Types of e-triggers

In the primary care setting, several types of e-triggers have been
previously described.

- Missed test results
    - Colon cancer (FOBT, FIT, iron deficiency anemia)
    - Lung cancer (imaging findings)
    - TSH
    - HCC (alpha-fetoprotein)
    - Bladder cancer (hematuria)
    - Mammography
    - PSA

- Care Escalation: Primary care visit followed closely by
  hospitalization, ER, urgent care, or unplanned primary care visit.

## Case study

A short case study will illustrate the use of this guide. In
particular, this is not a guide for only implementing an e-trigger,
but a guide for *deciding* the best e-trigger to implement, *and then*
proceeding to implement it.

> The VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System wanted to implement an
> e-trigger to improve follow-up of abnormal tests in primary care.
> After performing some self-assessment activities, they found out
> that a large initiative already existed for follow-up of abnormal
> mammograms and lung imaging. On the other hand, they were aware of
> suboptimal follow-up of outpatient unexplained hematuria,
> contributed to by several system factors. Therefore, they selected a
> bladder cancer (hematuria) e-trigger as their top e-trigger of
> interest.




# (5) Strategy: Implement electronic health record-based trigger and prepare for chart review

This section will guide users---particularly information
technology---in the practical aspects of implementing one or more new
e-triggers at their facility, with attention to any existing safety
feedback platforms at the facility. VA facilities may use EHR data to
inform their measurement of diagnostic safety, and this approach could
also be augmented with the strategy of soliciting information about
diagnostic safety directly from clinicians. Additionally, facilities
should address the following points:

1. Identify the appropriate EHR data warehouse for queries

2. Who will access the data warehouse and support the team with EHR
   queries?

3. What is the process for requesting EHR data, running queries, and
   generating reports?

4. Is there a team member who understands clinical data
   quality/validation?

Each site should decide who within the organization is ultimately
going to receive the data, meaning who is going to take action based
on it.[^feedback] In previous projects, database personnel at certain
sites did not know the names of the clinical team members who would
validate e-trigger cases; this should be avoided. Communication with
end users will also guide the format in which recipients wish to
receive feedback and ensure all the desired data elements will be
retrieved by the e-trigger code. See also: VA's *Communication Of Test
Results Toolkit*.[^toolkit]




# (6) Review: Review of e-trigger identified cases to confirm accuracy, and any required e-trigger customization.

An important step in the development of any e-trigger is ensuring its
accuracy and clinical relevance. This is achieved by the verification
of the output data generated by the e-trigger, and this section of
*Safer Dx EnGAGE* will orient users to this process. This will cover
field testing of the e-trigger's accuracy, a multi-step process where
the retrieved data are systematically reviewed by clinically trained
staff serving as chart reviewers. Following the chart review, any
necessary amendments will be made, and then the new e-trigger's output
data is again reviewed by chart reviewers.

1. These chart review processes will identify data quality and
  completeness issues of the e-trigger results. Chart reviewers may
  confer with the members of the stakeholder team (especially clinical
  leaders and clinicians) to determine whether the e-trigger meets the
  project and organizational goals or whether changes to the e-trigger
  are needed.

2. This information will provide feedback to the data
  analysts/programmers responsible for developing the e-trigger so
  that they can incorporate changes to the data retrieval algorithm.
  Clinical stakeholders may suggest changes to the inclusion and
  exclusion criteria to the developers, who will revise the e-trigger
  code.

3. The newly revised e-trigger will be run, the same process of chart
  review to check for accuracy and clinical relevance will be
  repeated, and any changes recommended will be made to the e-trigger.
  This process will be repeated until the accuracy and clinical
  relevance reach or exceed the agreed threshold.

4. Once the e-trigger has been optimized and clinicians confirm its
  accuracy, identifying opportunities for diagnostic
  safety improvements, this actionable information will be
  communicated to stakeholders (especially quality and safety
  personnel), who will need to become knowledgeable on how to
  operationalize it.

This e-trigger optimization process can be iterative and
time-consuming but is necessary to ensure the e-trigger achieves the
desired levels of accuracy and clinical relevance. Adequate time
should be allocated in the local implementation timeline and project
plan to accommodate this. Individual sites will determine how many
cases they can sample to review and validate during the chart review
process.

As outlined earlier, implementing sites will decide who will review
cases. Additionally, the data managers and programmers need to know
how to deliver the data to clinical personnel for validation. It is
therefore essential to a smooth e-trigger validation process that
these members of the team communicate and work together in a cohesive
and integrated way. Lastly, the *Revised Safer Dx
Instrument*[^revised] will be central to determining the
presence/absence of missed opportunities for diagnosis.




# (7) Assessment: Analysis of e-trigger implementation

## Putting knowledge obtained into action

The results retrieved from the e-trigger may be in a format that is
not conducive to interpretation by personnel from diverse backgrounds.
To maximize utilization of the results obtained, this stage of the
project will focus on improving user interfaces of the tools used to
display the data. Engagement with informatics personnel will help
disseminate the e-trigger results. Participants will analyze and
communicate the retrieved data by way of graphs, reports, interactive
dashboards with drill-down capabilities, and other enhanced data
visualization mechanisms.

In addition to developing visualization tools for displaying the
results, informatics personnel in the stakeholder team will support
the sustainability of the e-triggers by being closely involved with
the enhancement of the queries. Front-line users will give feedback to
data personnel, which will inform standardized data definitions,
analytical approaches, and methods to display and communicate the
e-trigger results. This documentation process for the e-trigger
queries and other associated technical requirements will enable future
enhancements as necessitated by changes in organizational operations.

## Developing strategies to learn from the e-triggers

Site stakeholders should review and determine how the e-triggers were
used for (1) analysis, (2) feedback, and (3) learning. Project
completion/debriefing meetings may be held to gather feedback from
clinical leaders, clinicians, and the wider stakeholder team. This
step aims to recommend ways that users can choose a diagnostic safety
target considering organizational priorities, available resources, and
availability of data relevant to the team's goal.




# Addendum: Implementing elsewhere

What if you are a future user of *Safer Dx EnGAGE* who wants to
implement e-triggers in a VA, but *using Cerner?* Or what if you
happened upon this guide but don't work within VA?
