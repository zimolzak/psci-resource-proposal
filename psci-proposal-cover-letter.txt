Dear ____:

My ____ and I are pleased to present a proposal for *title,* which
will be a guide to implementing electronic triggers (e-triggers) for
diagnostic safety at VA medical centers.

We want to empahsize that this is the **proposal** for the guide, not an outline for the guide itself. We hope you and your staff will help us develop the guide, using this proposal coupled with your expertise.

Again, the attached document is only the **proposal,** meaning it does
not have the content or wording of the final guide, which we hope you

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Best,
