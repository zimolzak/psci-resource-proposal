Dear ____:

My colleagues and I are pleased to present a proposal for *Safer Dx
EnGAGE,* which will be a guide to implementing electronic triggers
(e-triggers) for diagnostic safety at VA medical centers.

We want to empahsize that this is the **proposal** for the
implementation guide, not an outline or draft of the guide itself.
This means that the attached proposal document does **not** have the
content or wording that the final guide will have. We hope you and
your staff will help us develop the final implementation guide, using
this proposal coupled with your expertise.

This project will be advantageous because it will identify patients at
risk for diagnostic safety events in primary care, via the electronic
health record. This will take place not only at your VA medical
center, but also a national level, once the implementation guide is
disseminated.

Thank you in advance for helping us turn this proposal into an
implementation guide that any VA can use to improve diagnostic safety.

<br/>

<br/>

Best,

<br/>

<br/>
